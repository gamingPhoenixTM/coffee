    We want to do a lot of stuff; we're not in great shape. We didn't get a good night's sleep. We're a little depressed. Coffee solves all these problems in one delightful little cup.

  <p>Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic
    steps;
     raw coffee beans must be <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a>,
     the roasted coffee beans must then be <a href="grinding.html">ground</a>, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (<a href="brewing.html">brewed</a>), and finally the
     liquid coffee must be separated from the used
     grounds.
  </p>
  <p>Coffee is usually brewed immediately before drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted, or already roasted and ground. Coffee is often vacuum packed to
     prevent
     oxidation
    and lengthen its shelf life.
